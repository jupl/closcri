* Closri
** About
This is a template for creating and developing ClojureScript applications. The original intent of this project is for myself to get acquainted with the world of Clojure and ClojureScript and have a personal quick starter.
** Variants
- [[https://github.com/jupl/closcri][Base]]
- [[https://github.com/jupl/closcri/tree/reagent][Reagent]]
** Goals and Features
- Baseline yet featureful environment for working with Reagent
- Use [[http://boot-clj.com/][Boot]] for easy extensibility and customization
- Development tools/setup out of the box
  - Live reloading, hot loading
  - Source maps
  - REPL using [[https://github.com/binaryage/dirac][Dirac]]
  - Testing and test watching
  - [[https://github.com/bhauman/devcards][Devcards]] included (can be used with testing)
- Standalone asset builds
- Standalone devcards builds
- Linting and code analyzing can be checked
** Quick Start
1. Follow the [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install][instructions for installing Boot]]
2. Clone/download this repository
3. Run one of tasks defined below. If this is your first time using this dependencies will automatically be downloaded.
4. View project structure and customize =build.boot= to fit your needs.
For example, you can run ~boot dev~ to start the development environment. From there you can visit =http://localhost:3000= to view the current build and =http://localhost:3000/devcards.html= to view devcards.

|-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =resources/**=                | Static assets or files that map to a built file                     |
| =resources/**/*.cljs.edn=     | [[https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-cljs/wiki/Usage#multiple-builds][Define]] a JS file that will be compiled from =src=                   |
| =resources/devcards.cljs.edn= | Define that references files with devcards in them                  |
| =src/**/*.cljs=               | ClojureScript source files                                          |
| =src/**/*_test.cljs=          | ClojureScript test files                                            |
| =src/app/config.cljs=         | Settings that can be set by the build tool using ~:closure-defines~ |
** Tasks
*** =dev [-d] [-p PORT ]=
Start the development server complete with live updates, source maps, REPL, and devcards. If you want to omit devcards use the =-d= option. To run the server under a different port number use the =-p= option. (example to run server in port 8000: =boot dev -p 8000=)
*** =build=
Create a production build with optimizations. Devcard related items are omitted.
*** =devcards=
Create a standalone build of devcards only, ready to share.
*** =test=
Run all CLJS tests once. If tests are defined with devcards, those are included.
*** =tdd=
Run all CLJS tests once and run again on file changes. If tests are defined with devcards, those are included.
*** =analyze=
Check and analyze source code.
